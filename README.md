# expo-docker
Dockerfile to build expo based react-native applications.

Container packaged with expo-cli and can start developing any expo react application.

```docker pull sonyarouje/expo-buster```
or
```docker pull sonyarouje/expo-buster:<expo-cli version>```

Check [sonyarouje docker repo](https://hub.docker.com/r/sonyarouje/expo-buster/tags) for available expo-cli versions.

**VS Code Remote debugging**
I wrote a [blog post](https://sonyarouje.com/2019/08/02/expo-react-native-development-in-docker/) about how to use VS Code to connect to a docker container and develop from a container.
